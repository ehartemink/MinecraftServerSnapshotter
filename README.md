## What's this?

If you play minecraft, you can host your servers on Shockbyte. This script saves a local copy of the remote server worlds periodically. You know, in case something dumb happens.

If you're running this for the first time, create your config file `config.sh`, and run `./setup.sh`. Once you've done that you can backup your minecraft world with this script, just `./main.sh`
